# DroidSense-Lite 📱

An independent Python tool for Android that talks directly to the kernel. 
No heavy APIs, just raw hardware awareness.

## Philosophy
Inspired by the idea that a system must "feel" its environment to be truly independent. 
Instead of just processing data, this library monitors the "pain" (heat) and 
"energy" (battery) of the device to take autonomous actions.

## Usage
1. Clone this to your Android (via Termux).
2. Run `python droidsense.py`.
